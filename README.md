Hi there ðŸ‘‹, I'm Siddhant Dhoot

================================



I am an aspiring quantitative finance professional, currently on a structured and intensive learning path in preparation for my \*\*Global Markets Summer Analyst\*\* role at \*\*Nomura\*\* in \*\*Summer 2026\*\* and exploring my interest in finance at large.



\## The Mission: The "Nomura 2026 Global Markets Analyst: Enhanced Mastery Plan"



This GitHub profile serves as a living document of my self-directed educational journey. The repositories you'll find here contain mini-projects and practical applications from the courses I am completing as part of my personal development plan. My goal is to build a deep, functional understanding of the quantitative and technical skills essential for success in today's financial markets.



Each project corresponds to a key area of study, including:



\* \*\*Python for Data Science \& Finance:\*\* Data manipulation with Pandas, API usage, and financial data analysis.

\* \*\*Time Series Analysis:\*\* Implementing and testing models like ARIMA/SARIMA for financial forecasting.

\* \*\*Machine Learning for Trading:\*\* Feature engineering, back testing, and applying models like Neural Networks to trading signals.

\* \*\*Financial Engineering \& Risk Management:\*\* Practical implementation of concepts like derivatives pricing, portfolio optimization, and risk metrics (VaR, ES).



\## Project Philosophy \& Disclaimer



The code in these repositories is created for \*\*educational purposes only\*\* as a way to apply and solidify my understanding of complex financial and statistical concepts.



Please note:



1\.  I do not claim this code is proprietary or suitable for production use.

2\.  The projects are my personal implementation of concepts learned through various courses and online resources. Where applicable, I may have adapted or used code snippets from these educational materials, and all credit belongs to the original authors.



I am excited to bring this passion for learning and practical application to my role at Nomura. Thank you for visiting my profile!
