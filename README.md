<p>

This GitHub profile serves as a living document of my self-directed educational journey. The repositories you'll find here contain mini-projects and practical applications from the courses I am completing as part of my personal development plan. My goal is to build a deep, functional understanding of the quantitative and technical skills essential for success in today's financial markets.

</p>



<p>Each project corresponds to a key area of study, including:</p>

<ul>

&nbsp;   <li><strong>Python for Data Science \& Finance:</strong> Data manipulation with Pandas, API usage, and financial data analysis.</li>

&nbsp;   <li><strong>Time Series Analysis:</strong> Implementing and testing models like ARIMA/SARIMA for financial forecasting.</li>

&nbsp;   <li><strong>Machine Learning for Trading:</strong> Feature engineering, backtesting, and applying models like Neural Networks to trading signals.</li>

&nbsp;   <li><strong>Financial Engineering \& Risk Management:</strong> Practical implementation of concepts like derivatives pricing, portfolio optimization, and risk metrics (VaR, ES).</li>

</ul>
